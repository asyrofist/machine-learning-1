# Machine Learning Programming Assignments
- all algorithms implemented in Python v3.6.4
- Packaged limited to:
  - Numpy (1.13.1)
  - Scipy (0.19.1)
  - Matplotlib (2.0.2)
  - Pandas (0.20.3)
  ----------------------------------------
## PA1:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - distance functions
    - normalization
  - Decision Trees
    - pruning
## PA2:
  - Binary and multiclass classification
  - linear regression
## PA3:
  - MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)
    - Activation Functions (forward and backward): linear, relu, tanh
    - dropout
## PA4:
  - K-Means 
    - basic K-means clustering algorithm
    - K-means++ algorithm
  - Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
    - forward function, backward function, sequence probability, posterior probability, viterbi algorithm
    - part-of-speech tagging
## Comments:
  - PA4_HMM: my implementation of speech tagging achieves a 24.5% improvement in testing accuracy over the class's expected maximum
